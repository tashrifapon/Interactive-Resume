## ? Why I Built It
### Background
I started of focusing primarily in the backend, so my earlier work (like my website) started off as such. Not long after, I started doing more (nice and private) full-stack work. My assumption was that whoever arrives at my website/resume would be impressed by the work I had already done. I realized it is not a good look from most that an aspiring SWE has such a blank website; they don't see my success in performance, backend, and private full-stack work.
### First Steps
I thought I would just make it a bit more acceptable: a background color and some formatting (centering a div, LOL). Me being me (curious, passionate, and data-centric), I started doing more (elaborated further on).
### Unintended Goodies
<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Having Something Complete (Technically and Literally) & Unique To Show For:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Although I have done impressive work, they are not authorized for the public eye. Now, I can show and speak about something full stack. In fact, I got to do it in a final round interview, not only full-stack but architecture too! Instead of the usual interview template,<b> your interview can and should be memorable!</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        Having something unique is important. Firstly, it is interesting by nature of it being unique. Secondly, <b>it demonstrates that you are beyond just someone that codes. You can show promise long-term.</b> Literally yesterday as I write this, another interviewer said this was the best interactive resume she has seen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Going back to my first point (and my second point), <b>having something to talk about is amazing in interviews</b>. You can avoid redundant pauses and being bombarded with just technical stuff. This bombardment is not a one way street; the interviewers may very likely remember that vibe. Give them a different vibe and stand out from others!
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <h4>See Where My Visitors Are From:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If I see my audience is from Nebraska or the DMV area, then I can assume that my embedded skills are receiving attention. Then, I can focus my resume (and coding) efforts on that (i.e. C/C++). <b>You want to come across as specialized not a jack of all trades, master of none!</b>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>See Which Buttons Clicked:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I can see which of my skill are in wanted and in which rank!
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>See Which Links Are Being Clicked:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Say I am short on time and want to revamp my profile to better my candidacy. If I see my LinkedIn is my most popular link, I want to direct my efforts to optimize that profile.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Fun:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Sometimes, we forget why we got into this beautiful field. This brought back the pleasant memories. It is motivating to continue on this path and support the realization that I am more than just a coder.
      </li>
    </ul>

</ul>
